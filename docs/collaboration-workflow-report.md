# Collaboration Workflow Report

## 1) Issues Created
Issue 1: Feature Request – User Authentication
This issue requested adding basic user authentication functionality, including email and password validation before login. The goal was to document authentication requirements clearly before implementing the feature.

Issue 2: Feature Request – API Endpoints
This issue requested adding basic API endpoints such as /health and /users for testing purposes. It helped define what endpoints were required and ensured consistency before development.

Issue 3: Feature Request – Conflict Resolution Proof
This issue was created to intentionally introduce and document a merge conflict in the README file. The purpose was to practice resolving conflicts and provide proof for the checkpoint requirements.

## 3) Review Simulation Evidence
For each pull request, I simulated a code review process to demonstrate collaboration.

Each PR received at least two review comments, such as:

Requests to clarify documentation wording

Suggestions to keep formatting consistent across files

One pull request (the conflict-related PR) included a “Request changes” review.
The change request asked for clearer explanation in the README and proper conflict marker removal.

I addressed the requested changes by updating the documentation and confirming the conflict was fully resolved before merging.

Before merging, I reviewed file changes, checked formatting, and ensured the project structure remained clean and readable.

## 4) Merge Strategy
Confirm you used **Squash and merge** and explain one benefit (clean history, easier rollback, etc.).
